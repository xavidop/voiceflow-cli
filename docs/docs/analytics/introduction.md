Voiceflow agents' analytics provide insights into how your users are interacting with your agents. It helps you understand how your users are interacting with your agents, what intents they are hitting, and where they are dropping off.

## Reference

The `voiceflow-cli` has a command that allows you to interact with your Voiceflow Agents' analytics from your terminal or from your CI pipelines.

To know more, you can run the `voiceflow analytics` command. For the usage, please refer to this [page](/cmd/voiceflow_analytics).
