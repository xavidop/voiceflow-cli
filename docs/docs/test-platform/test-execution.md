## Overview
Test Execution is the process of running your Test Suites against your Voiceflow applications to validate functionality, responses, and user experience flows.

## How Test Execution Works

### Manual Execution

You can run tests immediately in several ways:

- **From Test Suites Page**: Click the "Run Test" button on any test suite card
- **From Test Suite Editor**: Use the "Execute Test" button when viewing/editing a suite

### Status Indicators
- **Pending** ‚è≥: Test has been submitted and is waiting to start
- **Running** üîÑ: Test is currently executing
- **Completed** ‚úÖ: Test finished successfully with all validations
- **Failed** ‚ùå: Test failed due to validation errors or system issues
- **Scheduled** üìÖ: Test is queued for future execution


## Test Execution History

### Viewing Executions

Navigate to **Test Executions** to see:

- **Complete History**: All your past test executions
- **Execution Details**: Date, time, duration, and status for each run
- **Suite Information**: Which test suite was executed
- **Trigger Type**: Whether the test was run manually or scheduled

### Execution Details

Click on any execution to view:

- **Test Logs**: Detailed step-by-step execution logs
- **Results**: Pass/fail status for each test case
- **Timing Information**: How long each test case took
- **Error Details**: Specific failure reasons and debugging information

## Execution Types

- Manual Executions: Triggered by user action
- Scheduled Executions: Automated runs at specified times

## Understanding Test Results

### Success Criteria

A test execution is considered successful when:

- All test cases pass their validation criteria
- No system errors occur during execution
- All API calls complete successfully

### Failure Analysis

When tests fail, review:

- **Validation Errors**: Which specific validations failed
- **Response Differences**: How actual responses differed from expected
- **System Issues**: API connectivity or timeout problems
- **Configuration Errors**: Incorrect test setup or parameters

### Logs and Debugging

Execution logs provide detailed information for debugging tests.

## Execution Limits and Considerations

### API Limitations
- Respect Voiceflow API rate limits
- Monitor Voiceflow token usage to avoid quota exhaustion
- Plan execution timing to optimize resources

### Performance Factors
- Test complexity affects execution time
- Network latency impacts overall duration
- API response times vary based on bot complexity

### Data Retention
- Execution history is retained for your account
- Logs and results are available for analysis
- Export capabilities for external reporting
