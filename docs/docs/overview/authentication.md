# Authentication

## Voiceflow API Key

`voiceflow-cli` uses Voiceflow APIs. To interact with your Vocieflow projects you will need a [Voiceflow API Key](https://docs.voiceflow.com/reference/authentication). You can get your API Key in your Voiceflow project > Integration page. You can pass the API Key to the CLI using the `--voiceflow-api-key` flag or by setting the `VF_API_KEY` environment variable. `voiceflow-cli` also works with `.env` files. You can create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the `VF_API_KEY` variable to it.

The `voiceflow-cli` source code is open source, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/xavidop/voiceflow-cli) to learn more about the actions the tool performs.

## Base URL

The base URL for the Voiceflow API is `https://<api>.<subdomain>.voiceflow.com`. The default value is without subdomain: `https://<api>.voiceflow.com`. If you are using a different Voiceflow environment, you can pass the subdomain using the `--voiceflow-subdomain` flag.

`voiceflow-cli` uses Open AI APIs. To interact with Open AI you will need an API Key. You can get your API Key in your Open AI account.
