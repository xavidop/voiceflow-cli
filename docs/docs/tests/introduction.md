## What is this?

Use the Conversation Profiler to test user utterances and improve your agent's interaction model.

The Conversation Profiler supports **two distinct testing approaches** to validate your agent's conversation flow:

### üîß Traditional Interaction-Based Testing
Test the conversation flow with **predefined interactions** where you send specific user utterances to your agent and validate exact responses. This approach is ideal for:

- **Regression testing** to ensure specific responses remain consistent
- **Validation of exact conversation flows** with predetermined inputs and outputs
- **Quality assurance** for specific features or conversation paths

#### Reference

It is important to know which [suites](/tests/suites) and [tests](/tests/interaction-tests) you can build. Because of that, you can find the entire reference on the [Reference](/tests/suites) page. Suites and test are defined as `yaml` files.

### ü§ñ Agent-to-Agent Testing
Simulate **realistic conversations** using AI-powered agents that interact naturally with your Voiceflow agent to achieve specific goals. This approach is ideal for:

- **End-to-end conversation testing** with natural, adaptive interactions
- **User behavior simulation** where the AI agent responds dynamically like real users
- **Goal-oriented testing** to ensure your agent can handle varied conversation paths

Both testing approaches can be run in your CI/CD pipelines and include additional features beyond the Voiceflow console's Test Agent feature. Every suite is executed in the same Voiceflow user's session.

All of the commands that are available in `voiceflow-cli` to execute the Conversation profiler are located within the [`voiceflow test` subcommand](/cmd/voiceflow_test).

#### Reference

It is important to know which [suites](/tests/suites) and [tests](/tests/agent-to-agent-tests) you can build. Because of that, you can find the entire reference on the [Reference](/tests/suites) page. Suites and test are defined as `yaml` files.

## Execution

The `voiceflow-cli` has a command that allows you to run these suites from your terminal or from your CI pipelines.

To execute a suite, you can run the `voiceflow test execute [suitesPath]` command. For the usage, please refer to this [page](/cmd/voiceflow_test).

## Examples

You can find some useful examples on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/xavidop/voiceflow-cli/tree/main/examples) and the [Examples](/tests/examples) page.


## Execution Example

Here is a simple example of the `voiceflow test execute` command:

```sh
voiceflow test execute examples/test/
```

The above command will give you output similar to the following:

```sh
$ voiceflow test execute examples/test/

!!! info "Are you running this command in a CI/CD pipeline?"
    If this is the case, we recommend that you set the `--output-format` parameter to `json`.
