The Documents are items that are uploaded to the Knowledge Base. They can be used to store information that can be used to answer questions or provide information to the users. The documents can be uploaded in various formats like PDF, Word, Markdown, etc. The documents can be processed using the LLM model to generate questions, summarize content, etc.
